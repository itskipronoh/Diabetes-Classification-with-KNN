## Diabetes Classification with KNN

# Overview
This project aims to classify diabetes using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The dataset used for this project is obtained from the IBM Skills Network. The objective is to predict whether a person has diabetes based on certain medical measurements.

# Results
The model's performance can be evaluated using the confusion matrix and classification report printed in the console. Additionally, the error rate plot helps in determining the optimal number of neighbors (K) for the KNN algorithm.
